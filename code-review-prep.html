<p>Hannah Fowler, Kai Levy, Hieu Nguyen, Wilson Tang
Software Design 02, Spring ‘15</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>We are DJ Phat Enchantah. Our goal is to create a DJ that will take your music and create the swaggiest, most hip mix of your songs.  </p>
<p>Echonest:
    We recently discovered Echonest following the design review. It contains a multitude 
    of libraries for music developers across different platforms. Moreover, its API holds an 
    array of data consisting of a song’s components such as its beat, pitch, key, etc. 
Echonest Remix: 
    What Echonest offers that does some incredible things is its Echonest Remix API. This 
    allows someone to “remix, re-edit, and reimagine any piece of music and video.” 
Some examples people have created using remix: </p>
<ul>
<li>play a song forever</li>
<li>reversing everything in a song</li>
<li>beat matching</li>
</ul>
<p>What we plan to talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have created a macro-layout of our code, separated into three sections: 
API (data retrieval) → we will show you this during the review </li>
<li>Analyzing songs (for doing cool things with it)**</li>
<li>Main code (for putting everything together) </li>
</ul>
<p>Main things to think about: </p>
<ul>
<li>storing the data we retrieve (We have thought of something but we want your
unbiased opinion on it, so please think about it. Lists? Dictionaries? Tuples? A
combination?) </li>
<li>analysis of the data** (best way to find the chorus? Default time for song snippet? 
Knowing when to transition? What transitions to use: fade-ins?) </li>
</ul>
<p>**We will show an example of the code at this point and talk through it</p>
