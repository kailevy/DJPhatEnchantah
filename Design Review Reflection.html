<p>Review process reflection</p>
<p>We think the review went quite well, given that we haven&#39;t done much and had just started working with the Echonest Remix that morning.</p>
<p>We had three main questions going into the review: what DJ things should we incorporate, how to manipulate beats and phrases, and which package (LibRosa or Echonest Remix) should we move forward with. We had quite a bit of feedback on the DJ effects, added with the review we sought from Scott after the review, so that was good. It wasn&#39;t quite fair to ask about the packages though, since only we know what either package is capable of and therefore we should have that decision ourselves instead of asked for opinions. As for manipulation of beats/phrases, we don&#39;t think we received quite enough feedback, but that was probably because no one really had any idea how to manipulate music at that point in time (since all teams were still experimenting with libraries).</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think we provided much context, but that was mainly because we didn&#39;t really know what we were doing.</p>
<p>I think we followed our agenda quite closely. Since we did not have a clear cut plan going into the review, we didn&#39;t really end up with a &#39;change of plans&#39;. </p>
<p>For next time, we definitely could have played around with the Echonest Remix package a bit more before the review. Neither of us had much of an idea what we were talking about, so that probably led to why we did not receive as much useful feedback as we had hoped.</p>
