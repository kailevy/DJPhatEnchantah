**Design Review**

# Background
*We are DJ Phat Enchantah. Our goal is to create a DJ that will take your music and create the swaggiest, most hip mix of your songs.*

- We intend to make a fully automated computer DJ
- It should make mixes that are smooth to the ear and danceable
- It should do the key things that a DJ does, such as..
  - Effective beat matching
  - Proper song phrasing
  - Logical song progression
  - Tasteful effects

# Key Questions
- What known libraries and APIs should we consider and experiment with?
  - LibRosa (suggested by Paul)
  - Echonest API, Echonest Remix
- What other things makes a mix good? What does a good DJ do?
- How should we tackle the challenges of audio analysis with respect to beat matching and phrasing?

# Agenda
- Introduce ourselves, our project
- Describe MVP: Generate a 'smart' playlist based off of songs given
- Describe full goal (above)
- Describe DJ features
- Note potential libraries and ask for feedback
- Outline tentative project plan
- Get more feedback!
