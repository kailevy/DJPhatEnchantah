<h1 id="reflection-and-synthesis-code-review">Reflection and Synthesis: Code Review</h1>
<p>From this code review, we received great feedback overall. Some of the key points that were noted consist of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fading to an equilibrium while transitioning from one song to another</li>
<li>Needing to complete a measure before transitioning to the next</li>
<li>A point of contact to consider is the DJ working on Saturday </li>
<li>We don&#39;t necessarily need to match beats
Given this feedback, our next step is to look more into finding the chorus of a song and fading during the measures following the end of a chorus. </li>
</ol>
<p>Our review itself wasn&#39;t perfect, but preparing for it was difficult because this is the first time our team has all been together. We have already experienced miscommunication; however, we feel that today went fairly smoothly and our most important questions were answered. We have a clearer direction to head in, and will continue to use Echonest. 
Looking at our Powerpoint, some of our slides were redundant and we probably didn&#39;t need as many as we did, but outlining our code architecture was helpful.</p>
