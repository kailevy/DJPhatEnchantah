Project
Proposal 

**The
Big Idea**

We are investigating automated music analysis with our project. We will
attempt to analyze traits of song (tempo, timbre, chords, pitch) and
note similarities to other songs in a library. Our minimum viable
product will be to generate quantitative analysis of the various
traits, while we will aim to have a DJ that would generate playlists
based off of a starting song, with continuous and minimally intrusive
fading. And as a further stretch, being able to mashup songs would be
pretty sweet. 

**Learning
Goals**

- Learn about various libraries for music
    analysis 
- Work well as a software development team 
- Use github well 
- Good code stuff 
- Discover ourselves 

**Implementation
Plan**

Do
research into music analysis libraries for python-- one that Paul
noted was called ‘librosa’, but there may be other useful
libraries. Learn how to use them and do it.

**Project
Schedule**

Split
up into mini-deliverables that are timeboxed into 2 weeks. 

Mini-deliverable 1: 

**Research and Testing** (mainly complete minimum viable product)

        Mar 23 - Apr 6

        Wilson gone Mar 23-30

        Hannah gone Apr 1-4

Mini-deliverable 2:

**Definitely complete minimum viable product by end of this timeframe**

        Apr 6 - 20

        Kai gone Apr 7-13

Mini-deliverable 3:

**Time for exploration + reach goal**

        Apr 20 - 30

**Collaboration
Plan**

    Split
tasks and continuously integrate

    Pair
program when integrating individual works

**Risks**

Learning
a library (dependent on finding a suitable library)

Team members’ absences

Successful music analysis

Getting the mix to sound good/natural like in real life

**Additional
Course 

Team Github organization (branching, merging etiquette)

Modular programming: how to split code into different folders/files
